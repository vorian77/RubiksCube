# RubiksCube
This project is a simulator and solver for the Rubik's cube puzzle that will be written in Python v3.8.

It will utilize Rubik’s Cube move conventions defined on rubiksplace.com, and will use the solving algorithm defined on speedcube.com.au.

The program will eventually be architected to allow for the solving of any sized, (square) Rubik’s style puzzle. The most popular 3x3 (6-sided/colored) cube will be implemented initially.

I'm transitioning to Python after 20+ years as a Windows PowerBuilder/PowerScript developer. I thought it would be fun to work on a challenging project as a companion to the tutorials I’m using to learn Python.

I will be updating the program as I learn more Python syntax, including refactoring to comply with proper coding conventions and software architecture.

In the spirit of the open-source computing, I would also like to share my skills development process in the hope that it will inspire and serve as a guide to other experienced developers who are making the transition from legacy languages to Python and other modern tools.
