# Rubkis'c Cube

This project is a simulator and solver for the 3x3 Rubik's Cube puzzle. 

I wanted to work on a fun and substantial project to learn and practice programming in Python.

It was inspired by seeing a video of [OpenAI's Rubik's Cube solver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4O8pojMF0w).
